# Examples of Classic Arcade Games

## Pong

Pong is really simple game. Two paddles on each side of the playfield which can move both up and down. The goal is to bounce the ball to the other players side and past his paddle. If the ball can not be cought using the paddle and it hits the left or right side the opposite player gains a point. It's a two-player game unless you add an artificial player (computer).

## Space Invaders

Space Invaders is a game from the seventies. The planet is attacked by aliens and it is your job to blast each and every one of them out of the sky. For this, you have the ultimate weapon at your disposal: a gigantic space cannon. This cannon can be moved from left to right to blast the alien ships who are trying to land on the surface of the planet. As the game proceeds, the alien ships get quicker and harder to kill.

## Galaxian

Galaxian was the Japanese's contender for Space Invaders. Very popular in the late 1970's. In Galaxian you control your own spaceship while trying to defeat hords of alien ships. Blast away those cannons. While able to move left and right, you can also advance forward an put the heat on those damn aliens.

## Tetris

Everyone knows tetris and it holds little secrets for us. Predefined shapes from above and your task is to fill the void below. Stack away and try to create horizontal lines to score those big points and get rid of those blocks. Ofcourse it gets harder with time and the blocks keep falling faster as if they were defying gravity itself.

## Donkey Kong
Donkey Donk has "apenapped" the love of your life and it's your job to save her. Few will know but this was the first game where Mario (from the later Mario Bros.) made his first appearance. Your weapons include a red hot smashing hammer and quick movement. Kong's biggest weapon is his size and the ability to throw keggs of beer at you. While most levels were single screen, some did expand sideways or vertically.
