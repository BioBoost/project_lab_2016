# Planning

Every group needs to submit a planning on the first project day. This is done using a project management platform called Redmine. The planning should differentiate between software, firmware and hardware design. Regular meetings between the group members who develop the software and the group members who develop the embedded hardware and firmware will definitely be needed here

By using Redmine as a project management system, you automatically get the feature of logs. Every task that needs to be done should appear as an issue in Redmine. Even those that might be cut later on as the project advances. Description messages should be short and to the point, however a minimum of 3 sentences is a good guideline.

At the end of each project day an evaluation will be made for each group based on the planning and logs of Redmine. Fine-tuning of the planning will be needed as the project advanced to paint a realistic picture of the progress and current state of the project.
